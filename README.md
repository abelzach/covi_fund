# covi_fund
Covi_fund provides a decentralized platform which can streamline donations to non-profit organizations/movements that strive for covid relief. Built using Polygon and Portis wallet.

# The problem it solves
Covi_fund is a Blockchain-based platform and provides greater transparency and is also immutable in nature.
Covid relief funds face declining donations among the young, increasing scepticism over CEO pay and concerns about where donations end up. At the same time, they struggle with inefficient, underfunded administration, often can’t direct aid adequately and frequently see the most vulnerable and needy miss out.
Donations can be done in crypto-currency (MATIC) to the respective organizations/movements and ensures direct and credible payments, avoiding the need for intermediaries. We build it using polygon blockchain and portis, and using Portis will make the dapp more accessible to the common people as it is integrated into the dapp they wouldnt have to install any additional wallets to get started . The smart contract has been deployed on Matic Mumbai by testnet.
The platform also enables individuals who are covid hit to make requests for financial support and receive contributions from the fellow users. So not only organizations but also individuals who requires covid relief are benefitted. Covi_fund provides an inclusive and efficient support forum for the society where people can help each other irrespective of their personal backgrounds . Covi_fund would be a significant leap towards social inclusivity.
